# n8n-webhook-chatbot-api
A simple webhook-based chatbot built with n8n. This workflow receives user messages via a webhook, processes them using conditional (IF) logic, and returns a JSON response. It replies to “hello” with a greeting and provides a fallback message for other inputs. Ideal for learning n8n automation and REST API workflow basics.
